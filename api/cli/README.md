# What is this directory?

This directory contains a series of useful CLI-based tools that can help with
various tasks required to bootstrap the application without using the
administrative dashboard.

For example if you want to generate a properly hashed password for use with
Survey Access Groups, you can use:

`node cli/hashPassword.js`

## USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Please note that CLI tools have been provided but should be used at your own risk. There is no guarantee that these tools with function in the same manner as the administrative tools provided within the GUI.
